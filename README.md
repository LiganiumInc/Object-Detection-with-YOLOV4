# Object-Detection-with-YOLOV4

YOLO `(“You Only Look Once”)` is an effective real-time object recognition algorithm, first described in the seminal 2015 paper by Joseph Redmon et al.

In this notebook I use one of the algorithm’s open-source implementations: `Darknet`<br>

You can use it and upload your own video.
